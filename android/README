About
=====

This is a work-in-progress port of Cinder to Android.  It uses the NDK Native
Activity code, which restricts it to running on Android versions 2.3
(Gingerbread) and upwards.

Tested to build on Windows (cygwin) and OSX, but it should work on Linux too.


Quickstart
==========

* Install prerequisites as required:

  - Android SDK and Android NDK R5c
  - (Windows only) Junction (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896768)
  - bash, curl, unzip, tar and bzip2 command-line tools (required by setup-android script)

* Run setup-android then build the Cinder static library from $CINDER_ROOT/android

  % cd cinder/android
  % ./setup-android
  % ndk-build

* Build one of the sample programs (AndroidTest, FBOBasic, iPhoneAccelerometer
  or MultiTouchBasic)

  % cd cinder/samples/<SAMPLE>/android
  % ./setup-android
  % ndk-build && ant debug && adb install -r bin/<SAMPLE-APK>


Status
======

* console() output goes to the Android debug log
* loadResource opens files embedded from the project "assets" folder
* FreeImage image source, tested to work with PNG/JPG/BMP files so far


TODO
====

* Android save/restore state callbacks
* Text support (Font/TextureFont, to be implemented with Freetype/Harfbuzz)
* Audio support (using OpenSL ES)
* Vertex buffer objects and GLES2 (related)
* URL implementation (currently stubbed out)
* Camera capture (may require JNI)
* Better filesystem support
